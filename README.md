THESE ARE WHAT HAVE LEARNT FOR THE PAST WEEKS HAVE BEEN AT RENU

RENU TASKS
Tuesday 3rd July 2023 (session by William)
‚óè	Introduction to Operating Systems (Windows and Linux).
‚óè	Using Git and GitHub this was mainly for version control (Weekly Updates on Git)
‚óè	Comparison between Windows and Linux.
‚óè	Discussing the different Linux distros like Red hart and many others.

The session was amazing and very eye opening to me, and I realized that choice of operating systems depends on what you will use the resources for as well as tasks you hope to accomplish.

Wednesday 4th July (session by Claire)
‚Ä¢	Installing VNC Viewer, 
‚Ä¢	a VNC client for access to the virtual environment
‚Ä¢	Remote Installation of windows server 2019
             Remote login with RDP (Diff between RDP and VNC)
The major difference with RDP and VNC includes the fact that much as both of them allow users access to and allow remote computers over a network., RDP is proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft to provide remote desktop services primarily between windows devices. And VNC is platform independent

This session was very educative as well I was able to use SSH to login remotely without a password and also use VNC for Linux but failed to do so for windows

We were then given a project and I joined group 2 that will be carrying out penetration testing. 

WEEK 3 
This week has been fun packed with two visits from Brook all the way from GEANT as well as Ivan Walulya all the way from Oracle open JDK team of Sweden.

TUESDAY 11TH JULY 2023.

C2 ‚Äì Switching (Cleo & Nicholas Mugabe & Grace)
‚óè	Layer 2 switching & Limitations
‚óè	Bridges & Switches
‚óè	The 3 layer-2 switch functions
‚óè	The Spanning Tree Protocol, The STP was not covered in depth but I got to interact with physical devices that Grace provided like cables and routers.
LAN switch types

This was I must say the most interactive session have had and the trio facilitators are amazing. 

WEDNESDAY 12TH JULY

C3 ‚Äì VLANs (Victor and Clinton)
‚óè	What VLANs are (Virtual Local Area Networks that are used to segment a network and control flow of traffic)

‚óè	Benefits of having VLANs (They help to segment a network, control flow of traffic anf reduce costs, with VLAs, geographical distance is not a problem)


‚óè	Static & dynamic VLANs (Static VLANs any port you have assigned a VLAN will always maintain that association unless you change that port manually while dynamic determines a node‚Äôs VLAN assignment automatically using a database).

Trunking (Access & trunk links). Access points tag and untag frames as they traverse the network while trunk carries what has been configured on its interface. 




Today Friday 14th July, I got to attend the Tecnical team meeting for last quater's reports.
